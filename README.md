# BuyOnline
### About the site:
BuyOnline is a client side driven website, which communicates with XML data  files on the Server.  All communication is handled by ActiveX or AJAX calls to php files, and where data from XML files is to be displayed, this is handled by XSL formatting the XML to HTML, and javascript DOM them manipulating the HTML page to insert the data.

The website utilises cookies (via javascript) to track the currently logged on customer or manager, as they traverse thru the site until they logout.

As the website is mostly HTML5/CSS3 compliant, it is best viewed using either Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.  (It has been tested on IE 8, but due undeveloped support for HTML5, it does have some display bugs when rendering).

The original template for this site was developed for the subject COS10011 (Internet Technologies), so the CSS does contain a lot of legacy code from its original purpose which serves no function here.

### Using the Site:
The default or usual ‘home page’ of most websites, would normally be ‘Index.html’.  In the purpose of this site, we’ve made the home page ‘buyonline.html’.
